OSMtracker layout for hydrants (german)

orignally published at https://www.einsatz-monitor.de/tour_demo.php?page=osmtracker

extended to distinguish underground and above ground hydrants during recording

== How to use ==
This repository was originally intended to be connected to directly from the OSMtracker app to download the layout online.
This has not worked, however.

To use the layout offile:
* OSMtracker can be installed via F-droid market
* create a dummy recording with OSM tracker on Android phone
* export to GPX (it seems the working folder "osmtracker" is first created on the first export)
* create a supfolder "layouts" in the "osmtracker" folder
* place layout xml file in the "layouts" folder
* The layout will be available in settings Einstellungen / Tastenvoreinstellungen
